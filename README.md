# mspm - Minecraft Server Package Manager

Handle plugins, mods, datapacks, loaders, etc much like you would handle libraries in javascript using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh)

## Install

### Linux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ValentinRapp/mspm/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Windows

- Clone repo somewhere on your computer and [build project](#build-project-from-source)
- Add ``[repo_location]/dist`` to your [PATH](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/)

> You can update the tool whenever you want by running ``git pull`` at the root of the repo and building it again

## Get Started

### Initializing a new minecraft server

```bash
mspm init
```
This prompts you a few options and setups a basic minecraft server using the loader you want *(Paper, Fabric, Vanilla, ...)*

You can then run the server by executing ``run.sh`` or ``run.bat`` depending on your platform

Take a look at what you can do with this tool using ``mspm help``
